Some notes:

    - This is to accomodate the typed instances in functions
    - If you cannot/do not want to use 3.9, please remove all instances of type[type] in function declarations

- It is recommended to run this on a Linux or UNIX based system
    - Allows you to make full use of the generators for the log files
    - Python functionality has different behaviors at times with regards to Windows. The code has not been fully optimised for Windows
